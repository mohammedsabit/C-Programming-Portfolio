# C Programming Portfolio: Memory & Algorithms

## 📌 Academic Context
I am a Statistics graduate (B.Sc.) focused on mastering Computer Science fundamentals and Algorithmic Thinking. I undertook this intensive C programming curriculum to gain a deep understanding of **Memory Management**, **Pointers**, and **Low-Level Logic**.

## 📂 Technical Syllabus

### 🔹 01. Core Concepts & Logic
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementation of Selection Sort (Logic building).
- **Mathematical Logic:** Divisor calculation and Pattern printing (Nested Loops).

### 🔹 02. Arrays & String Manipulation
- **Data Cleaning:** Implementing Frequency Arrays (Histograms) for data counting.
- **Text Processing:** Palindrome detection and String parsing logic.
- **Optimization:** Two-pointer technique for array reversal (Memory efficient).

### 🔹 03. Functions & Recursion
- **Modular Programming:** Encapsulating logic into reusable functions.
- **Recursion:** Solving Stack-based problems (Factorials, Array Traversal).

### 🔹 04. Pointers & Memory Management
- **Direct Memory Access:** Using Pointers to manipulate variable addresses.
- **Call-by-Reference:** Efficiently passing data to functions without duplication.

### 🔹 05. Matrices (2D Arrays)
- **Linear Algebra Logic:** Diagonal analysis and Matrix Traversal.
- **Distance Metrics:** Implementation of Manhattan Distance (Geometry).
- **Search Algorithms:** Linear Search in 2D grids.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Converting mathematical formulas into executable code.
- **Memory Management:** Understanding Stack vs. Heap and Pointer Arithmetic.
- **Code Organization:** Writing modular, readable, and documented C code.
